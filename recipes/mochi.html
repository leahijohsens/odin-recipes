        <p>This is an example of the mochi we will be making today. It looks like a bar of soap but it isn't. It is mochi and it is really easy to make even though it looks really bad. I really love mochi. Mochi ice cream is really good but this is not what we are making today. Today we are making really easy mochi that does not contain ice cream. It will be so yummy. Wow. Yum. SOOOOO YUMMY</p>
